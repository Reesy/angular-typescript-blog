# AngularTypeScriptBlog
Basic CRUD single page app blog written using Typescript, AngularJS and mongodb for practice early in my career.

**-- NOTICE ---**

This project was used to practice AngularJS, this project predates the use of @types, so types are bundled. 
I don't recommend using this project. I've kept this because I find it interesting to see the progression of the angular framework.
